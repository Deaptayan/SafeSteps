SafeSteps is a concept app for the increment of womens safety, this is my project for my fisrt Hackathon- Hack Ur Way organised by IIC Techno Main Salt Lake.
The Code given here may not work properly because it is orginally built with MIT App Inventor, because of lack of time had to use that or else we could'nt submit anything to the hackathon.
I have also uploaded the apk and the aia file for this app in this.
download the "APK" file to use the app directly.
or you Can upload the "AIA" file to the MIT App Inventor to work with it.
